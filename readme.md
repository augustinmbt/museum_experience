# Astronomy Museum Experience :earth_africa:
We made this project for an Dev Week at school, the subject was to use the WebGL techo in a fully working website. 
We decided to create a museum around Astonomy and found the 3D model on  [Poly](https://poly.google.com) Google, we give a special shotout and a big thank you to [Joshua Johanson](https://www.google.com) who published his 3D model for free. We also give a special thanks to our teacher _the great_ Bruno Simon who has been very helpfull during all his classes.

## Techo used :wrench: 
This project is based around the JavaScript language and the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) technology. The project is build arround the index.js file, we use some the help of WebPack

#### index.js :beginner:
This file allow us to create a scene and add all our meshes to it.
We use a /javascript folder to load all our models in a separated files. This allow us to have cleaner code as we only add meshs to the scene. 

#### WebPack :paperclip:
We used WebPack to be able to launch our localserver and this also transpiled our code to make it readable on quiet all search engine.

#### GitHub :octocat:
We used GitHub to be able to work together on the same project, we only had few conflicts has we created separated files to code.
